This website prototype is a interactive map using the google maps API with react and flask. 
Users can add custom messages on the map for other users to see. Friend other users. aswell as get directions. 
On the backend the everything is saved in sql alchemy tables. It stores the friends, destination, and tweets for each user.

The css for the website is less than glamorous but it is functional.
